		Users can start the push sequence by calling StartPushing if desired.
	Pull Sequence Changes:
		If pulling a grabbed object to the hand times out while trying to orient to the pose position, the hand will go retrieve
		the object if the remaining angle difference is greater than "Move Threshold". This should help prevent objects getting stuck
		when the fixed joint is created with the hand.

	Line Grabs no longer need to be aligned with the up vector of the physics hand, any orientation of the line is now allowed.
	Added LineFreeRotation (bool) to HVRPosableGrabPoint : if set to true the hand will always rotate freely about the defined line axis.

Socket Filter Updates:
	Added new Scriptable Object "HVRSocketableTags" - user can define up to 32 tags in this scriptable object without programming experience.
	Tags can be assigned to HVRTagSocketable and HVRTagSocketFilter which will cause a drop down to present itself for tag selection.

	when the climbing hand strength should remain active while held.
-Fixed and issue where buttons on scroll view could not be clicked when using the included UI Input Module.
-SFXPlayer : no longer changes the name of the pooled audio source to the sfx clip it's playing by default as using gameobject.name allocates garbage.

Layers:
LeftTarget and RightTarget have been collapsed into a single layer 'DynamicPose', the position of this layer does not matter, nor does it require any
	consideration in the collision matrix or for line of sight checks. 
	Be sure to add this layer after updating. The layer setup helper tool will replace this for you. 
	The layer helper tool will now pop up a message box with a report of the layer setup process.

	- 'RemoveRigidbody' mode no longer requires the socket to have a rigidbody

-HVRPosableGrabPoint 
	-JointOffset Renamed to HandRotationOffset. This rotation offset will no longer be applied to the hand to object joint, but will instead offset		
		the controller tracking target when this grab point is held. Existing users of this field will probably need to adjust their offsets.
	-Added HandPositionOffset - positional offset to apply to the controller tracking when held.
	
-HVRHandgrabber - added ControllerOffset field (HVRControllerOffset), auto populated from the 'TrackedController' field if that is populated.
-HVRControllerOffset 
	- updated to manage the additional offsets provided by grab points.

-Fixed an issue with the physics bow shooting direction because it shoots in the next frame after destroying the arrow joint.
-Fixed linked sockets from playing their grabbed SFX
-Fixed an issue where having multiple inspectors open with HVRPosableHand would cause the selected pose to pose the hand.
-HVRPosableHand : added "Preview Selected" button (with undo support) which will pose the hand with the pose in the Selected Pose field. 
	The hand will no longer immediately pose on Selected Pose field changed to prevent accidently ruining
	hand posing if the user clicks on the hand preview when multiple inspectors are open.
-Added OpenXR controller detection for hp reverb g2
-Reduced default collision ignore on grabbable release from 5s to .5s

Concave Collider Grabbable:

	 doesn't have concave colliders. Concave colliders will aim at the collider bound center.
	 Should help with distance grabbing objects with larger colliders.
-HVRGrabbable : Added 'GrabColliders', if populated only these colliders will be used to detect a grab.

HVRCollisionEvents : Added ImpulseOrVelocity option that triggers the threshold met event.
HVRHandAnimator : now updates poses in LateUpdate instead of Update
HVRHandGrabber : updates physics pose in LateUpdate

HVRHandMirrorSetting added 'AllSetting' applies to all fingers unless overidden.
HVRPosableHand - capsule placement is updated based on Barliesque's suggestion (works well!)
HVRSettings: Removed non local directory fields and added methods in their place instead as multiple people working on the same projecet
	probably do not have the same directory structure.


Release 1.93

Fixes:

Force Pull System now uses joints to pull the object, you may want to adjust the default settings to your own taste.
HVRForceGrabber: New ForcePullSettings field.
HVRGrabbable: New ForcePullOverride field.




HVRSocket: CheckHandOverlap: if true the socket must be detected by the hand "socket bag collider" to place the object in. This will help with misplacing long objects in body inventory slots by accident.

VR SDK Detection
HVRInputManager has been updated to detect which Input SDK is in use.
This will reduce the amount of components and toggles needed to get the scene ready.
SteamComponents to initialize steamvr and the hurricane action set
are now optional and can be removed as HVRInputManager will handle this by default.

Grab Indicator Updates:
Grab Indicators on the hands have been changed from GameObject enable / disable to HVRGrabbableHoverBase for subclassing flexibility.
 !! Beware that you may need to update your component references on your hands !!
HVRGrabbable New Fields:
 ShowForceGrabIndicator : bool 
 GrabIndicator : HVRGrabbableHoverBase - for overriding the default indicator from the hand grabber

Release 1.6

Bug Fixes:
Save grabbable rigidbody state only on the first grab of a two handed grab
Prevent rigidbody warning when restoring kinematic grabbable state
Line of sight check ignored when grabbing a force grabbed object
Handled Destroyed "Hovered Grabbables"
Center Of Mass, Inertia Tensor, and Inertia Tensor Rotation are returned to their pregrab state on release 
	instead of being recalculated which wipes out custom overrides
Fixed hand popping to the socket when placing due to joint destruction timing

Grab Updates:


New Line grab - create one grabpoint and pose with a start / end point and grab 
	anywhere on the axis (position and rotation), currently limited to Up axis of the hand. 
	Grabbing only with trigger frees the hand to move or rotate until grip is pressed again.
	Requires ParentHandModel = false.

New "MoveGrab" behaviour for the hand when grabbing. The hand will move to the grabbable and rotate into position instead of pulling
	the grabbable to the hand. This automatically happens for grabbables marked stationary or if the object is already grabbed.
	Experimental "HandGrabs" option is added to the HVRHandGrabber to enable this for all static posed grabs.
		
CloneHandModel defaulted to true on the Hand Prefabs, automatically clones the hand model and removes the colliders from the clone,
	the clone is used when parenting the hand to the grabbable instead of the original. This prevents inertia tensor and center of mass
	changes to the object from the addition of the hand colliders. This is also necessary for the hand rigidbody when performing a "MoveGrab" 
	which requires collisions of the hand to be temporarily disabled which triggers inertia and com recalculation. Alternatively the hand
	rigidbody can have it's COM and tensor overriden so that it cannot recalculate itself.

New GrabIndicator GameObject field on the Hand Grabber, if provided it will enabled and position itself at the grab point location 
	when hovering a grabbable. 

New ForcePull style added to the Force Grabber that uses physics forces, separate settings than Gravity Glove style

New IsJointAnchor field on the GrabPoint (defaulted false), the GrabPoint position will become the joint anchor instead of the palm of the hand,
	useful to stabilize the joint for objects that might be held by the finger tips instead of in the palm.
	
Parenting of the hand is now longer required for non stationary physics joint grabs that don't have joint offsets (WIP).
	Parenting still recommended for static stationary objects, like levers, drawers, handles etc.
	
HVRGrabbable:EnableInvisibleHand set false by default
Added hover haptics to distance grab
Grabbing from a socket now uses the "Primary GrabPoint" (ForceGrabberGrabPoint)
Kinematic Grabbables remain kinematic by default - if you unpacked the example back pack, disable kinematic as it was previously enabled in the prefab
Trigger grab option added to HVRPlayerInputs. When using Toggle grab mode the Trigger can only grab - not drop.
Gravity Glove style adds AutoGrabDistance, "auto grab" trigger grabbable bag removed.


Knuckles Update:
Added GripUseEither to HVRInputSettings - useful to use the GripForce Steambinding in addition to the Steam Grip Button action.
	This will allow your player to grab objects with just pinky, ring, or middle finger pressure;
Knuckles bindings updated to bind GripForce to the grip action.


Fixed Grab Joint Changes:
Fixed joints now create Locked axis Configurable Joints to simplify the jointing process
Grabbable Fixed Joint Settings [CanJointBreak, JointBreakForce, JointBreakTorque] are now deprecated and will be removed in the next update. 
Use JointOverride on the grabbable to set any break forces, they are infinity by default and will not break

Physics hand changes:
Legacy Joint Settings (pre 1.5) on the HVRJointHand component are now removed. JointSettings must be assigned now.

Pun Updates:
Pun Rig updated with recent additions and changes to hand and grabbable joint updates
Dynamic pose now works with CloneHandModel
Dynamic pose should work with not parenting

Release 1.54

Bug Fixes: fixed hand joint issue introduced in 1.53 for physics hands in older versions

Updates:

Updated HexaBodyVR Integration package

Physics hand changes:
Legacy Joint Settings on the HVRJointHand component are now marked deprecated and will be removed in the next update.
Use JointSettings instead, default player prefab since 1.5 already has the JointSettings applied

Release 1.53

Bug Fixes:
Fixed dynamic grab failing to create the final grab joint due to a rotation calculation error

Major Physics Hands Update:
Hand default mass has been set to 2, (5 is too high)
Hand default strength has been adjusted to reflect changes in the physics hand system
Hand max velocity removed as it isn't necessary, hand strength settings should be used instead.
Two hand grabs are much more stable with the physics hand updates
Updated the default hand prefab with COM and Inertia overrides to account for the capsules colliders on the fingers
which causes bad rotation correction and unexpected recoil directions
Hands can now keep up with the player even at high speeds.

Updates:
Add CanSprint and CanCrouch to the Player Controller
Added acceleration and decelleration options to the Player Controller
Organized the Player Controller inspector fields
Add ENABLE_LEGACY_INPUT_MANAGER around old input keyboard code for users using the new input system
Renamed DefaultHandSettings to HVR_DefaultHandSettings
Updated Player Controller to check if Teleporter component exists before using it
Disabled grab points are no longer added to the grab points list or considered for remote grab marker


Grabbable Updates:
Grabbable configurable joint settings are removed, HVRSettings.DefaultJointSettings or Grabbable.JointOverride must now be used
CollisionDetection field added to change the mode while held, defaulted to ContinuousDynamic
Removed the temporary joint override function, custom hand strengths and grabbable mass adjustments should be used instead

Release 1.52

Bug Fixes:
Fixed the dynamic grab having rotation issues after grabbing

Enhancements:

Added Clone Hand model option to the hand grabber that will clone the hand model and remove any colliders,
	if enabled the cloned hand model will be parented to the object instead of the original which stabilizes the rigidbody
	due to the rigidbody resetting it's properties with newly added colliders.
New HVRRigidBodyOverrides component that lets you override Center Of Mass, Inertia Tensor, and Inertia Tensor Rotation
Added grabbable inspector toggle to draw renderer bounding box and center of mass
Added HandGrabbed and HandReleased events to the Grabbable component

Added pull strength joint override to the grabbable which can be useful to customize pulling strength based on object mass
Add support for HP reverb 2 controller
Added input controller check for WMR controllers to determine if it has a track pad or not
Add Stationary flag to Grabbable which for objects that do not need to be pulled and rotated into to the hand

Add all SteamVR bindings and renamed existing to default file names
Second Grab Hand doesn't pull a 2nd handed grabbable
Update hand grabber break distance check to use the tracked controller for stationary items
Updated default grabbable joint settings to be position locked to prevent joint stretch

New assault rifle example with automatic fire, chamber check, charging handle, chambered round.
New pump shotgun example
Ammo can have damage, range, and force assigned
Pistol updated to use the new recoil system, chamber check, slide bullet eject
Grabbable can have additional colliders set for ignoring collision with the hands while grabbing
Grabbable can force overlap clearance or after a timeout for re-enabling collision with the hand after release
Posable hand supports less than 5 fingers
Posable hand capsule collider generation helper
Posable hand mirror settings to easily mirror poses for mirrored rigs
New waist tracking component that keeps the waist position when looking down

Add option to the HVRDamageHandler to be damageable or not.
A grabbable which requires another grabbable to be held, can now have the hand moved to the required grabbable if that one was released
Useful for something like the pistol stabilizer where you don't want the gun to drop if the main grip was let go.
Add stabilizer grip to the pistol
Added OnDeactivate to complement OnActivate to the grabbable component
Add option to player inputs to swap move/turn axis
